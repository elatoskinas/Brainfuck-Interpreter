# Brainfuck Interpreter (Assembly)

## Purpose
Assembly interpreter/semi-compiler for Brainfuck code. Runs Brainfuck code from specified Brainfuck code file.

## Usage
First make the program, then run ./brainfuck <brainfuck code file path>

## Credits
Makefile, main.s and read_file.s were not made by me. This was the boilerplate code provided for the project.
